                        This case is brought forth to rectify years of <strong>constitutional violations, parental

                            State of Ohio</strong>. Through a series of deliberate and coordinated actions, these
                        parties have <strong>denied me (Lamont Evans) my fundamental parental rights</strong>, alienated
                        my children from me for financial gain, and subjected me to <strong>unconstitutional state
                            enforcement actions</strong> that have caused irreparable harm to me and my children.

                    <h2>II. Theory of the Case: Legal and Factual Justifications</h2>
                    <p>
                        The theory of this case is <strong>built upon the fundamental constitutional rights of a parent
                            to maintain a meaningful relationship with their children without unjust interference from
                            the other parent or the state.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <div class="legal-framework">
                        <h3>This case seeks to establish that:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The State of Ohio (via the Family Court and Child Support Enforcement Agency)
                                    violated constitutional rights</strong> through unfair legal procedures and
                                financial penalties, effectively punishing a fit and willing father.</li>
                            <li><strong>Talicia Townsend engaged in a pattern of parental alienation and financial
                                    exploitation, using child support as leverage to deny equal parenting.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Talicia's husband played an active role in reinforcing and enabling the
                                    alienation, creating further obstacles to a healthy father-child
                                    relationship.</strong></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            By applying the <strong>relevant legal standards</strong> to the <strong>factual
                                record</strong>, this case will prove that these parties acted <strong>unlawfully and
                                unconstitutionally</strong>, causing significant harm to both the plaintiff (Lamont
                            Evans) and his children.

                        <h3>The Legal Framework Supporting Our Claims</h3>
                        <p>The case rests on <strong>three key legal principles:</strong></p>

                        <div class="violation-item">
                            <h4>1. The Fundamental Right to Parent (Fourteenth Amendment)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Legal Standard:</strong> The <strong>U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized
                                    parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment's
                                    Due Process Clause</strong> (Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 2000).</p>
                            <p><strong>Application to This Case:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The <strong>State of Ohio interfered with my parental rights without proper due
                                        process</strong> (e.g., child support increases without notice, unjust custody
                                    decisions).</li>
                                <li>The <strong>court denied my request for shared parenting in 2013 based on a
                                        procedural issue</strong> (failure of my attorney to file paperwork) rather than
                                    an actual evaluation of my fitness as a parent.</li>
                                <li><strong>Talicia actively interfered with my parental rights for financial
                                        gain</strong>, which the <strong>state enabled by enforcing unfair child support
                                        rulings.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="violation-item">
                            <h4>2. Due Process Violations (Fourteenth Amendment)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Legal Standard:</strong> Due process requires that <strong>before the government
                                    takes away property or liberty, an individual must have notice and an opportunity to
                                    be heard</strong> (Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 1976).</p>
                            <p><strong>Application to This Case:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In <strong>2019, the State of Ohio increased my child support without notifying me
                                        or giving me a chance to contest it.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>The child support system imposed penalties (license suspensions, wage
                                        garnishments) without allowing me to present a defense or argue my financial
                                        situation.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>I was denied a fair hearing before being subjected to financial
                                        punishment.</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>3. Equal Protection Violations (Fourteenth Amendment)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Legal Standard:</strong> The Equal Protection Clause requires that
                                <strong>similarly situated individuals be treated equally under the law</strong>
                                (Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 1972).

                            <p><strong>Application to This Case:</strong></p>

                                <li>I was subjected to <strong>discriminatory treatment based on my status as a

                                    treated.</li>
                                <li><strong>After being granted shared custody in 2015, I was still treated as a
                                        "non-custodial" parent for financial enforcement purposes,</strong> whereas a
                                    mother with equal custody would not have been required to pay child support in the
                                    same manner.</li>

                    <h2>VII. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        This case is about <strong>more than just financial restitution—it is about justice for my
                            children, for myself, and for every parent who has been unfairly denied their
                            rights.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For years, I was <strong>subjected to unconstitutional treatment, financial coercion, and
                            alienation from my children</strong> due to the actions of <strong>Talicia Townsend, her
                            husband, and the State of Ohio</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that my children are approaching adulthood, <strong>it is time to set the record straight
                            and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.</strong>
